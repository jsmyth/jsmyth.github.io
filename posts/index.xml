Thompson once said, &amp;ldquo;Good people drink good beer.&amp;rdquo; And in Northern California, good people also play good disc golf.
The disc golf courses of Northern California are an absolute treasure that few people outside of the sport truly appreciate. From the towering redwoods of Brooktrails to the stunning vistas on Zephyr Cove of Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada mountains (yes, techincally it&amp;rsquo;s in Nevada, but ya know), these courses offer an unparalleled experience of technical golf in the most stunning of settings.</description></item><item><title>Disc Golf Is Life</title><link>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/disc-golf-is-life/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 09:05:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/disc-golf-is-life/</guid><description>Disc golf, my wild and untamed companion, is a symphony of flight that leaves the soul soaring through the air. It&amp;rsquo;s a dance between man and nature, where plastic discs become vessels of liberation, and fairways turn into portals to untamed adventures. The beauty of disc golf lies not only in the graceful arcs and spins of the flying disc but in the essence of the hobo lifestyle it embodies.</description></item><item><title>Weekly Newsletter: 02</title><link>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/weekly-newsletter-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 08:14:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/weekly-newsletter-02/</guid><description>Hobo DG Bag Tag Top 5 Tag Hobo 1 coming soon 2 coming soon 3 coming soon 4 coming soon 5 coming soon Hobo Disc Golf Bag Tag Kick-Off!

Chains McGraw: &amp;ldquo;Ah, yes, Dr. Gonzo, what a character he was. Let me take you back to the &amp;rsquo;80s, a time of wild debauchery and even wilder disc golfing adventures.

Chains McGraw: &amp;ldquo;Ah, yes. The disc golf road trip. A quintessential American adventure, fueled by adrenaline, questionable substances, and the unyielding thirst for the perfect round. I remember one particular journey, back in &amp;lsquo;76.

He started off the week in the South Bay, resting up after a busy couple weeks of disc golf, but soon found himself heading north to the quaint college town of Chico California.
It was there that he reunited with his longtime friend and the owner/operator of Jimbo&amp;rsquo;s Print Disc Golf Bag Tags, Jim.</description></item><item><title>Psychology of Disc Golf</title><link>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/psychology-of-disc-golf/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 09:33:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/psychology-of-disc-golf/</guid><description>Disc golf is not just a physical sport but also a mental game. The psychology of disc golf is often overlooked, but it can play a significant role in one&amp;rsquo;s play. Many players face mental blocks and challenges that can hold them back from playing their best. However, with the right mindset, players can overcome these obstacles and improve their game.
One of the things that has helped me the most in many aspects of life, not just sports, in terms of mindset has been the philosophy of &amp;ldquo;Wei wu wei&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Do without doing&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Joe's Travels: 01</title><link>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/joes-travels-01/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/posts/joes-travels-01/</guid><description>As the sun slowly rose over Tulloch Lake in Jamestown, California, Hobo Joe &amp;ldquo;Chains&amp;rdquo; McGraw opened his eyes, greeted by the breathtaking view of the still waters reflecting the morning sky. The first rays of the day illuminated the surrounding hills, signaling the arrival of spring with its warm embrace and colorful display of wildflowers.
