In disc golf, just as with any other sport or activity, the more exposure you get to it, the more confusing it can be at the beginning. One of the contributing factors to this is the specific vernacular. Here we will layout some of the often-used disc golf terms that you will undoubtedly hear and could be somewhat confusing without the proper context.

## Disc Golf Speak
#### Shot Shapes / Types
- Air Bounce: An air bounce is a type of shot where the player throws the disc up into the air so that it hits the ground and bounces back up again. The disc then continues on its trajectory towards the target.
- Anhyzer/Anhy: An anhyzer is a type of throw where the disc is released with an angle that causes it to curve away from the player's dominant hand. This type of throw is often used to navigate around obstacles or to create more distance.
- Ahny-Flip: An ahny-flip is a type of throw where the disc is released with an anhyzer angle and then flips up to flat or even turns over to create a turnover shot.
- Backhand Roller: A backhand roller is a type of shot where the disc is released with a backhand motion and rolls along the ground. This type of shot is often used to navigate through tight spaces or to create a unique approach shot.
- Cut Roll(er): A cut roll is a type of shot where the disc is thrown at a hyzer angle, hits the ground, and then rolls in the opposite direction of the hyzer angle.
- Flex(-out): A flex-out is a type of shot where the disc is thrown with an anhyzer angle, then hyzers back towards the target before finishing with another anhyzer angle at the end of the flight. This shot requires a disc with a lot of stability to perform properly.
- Flick: A flick, also known as a sidearm throw or forehand throw, is a type of throw where the disc is released with a flicking motion of the wrist. This type of throw is often used for shorter, more accurate shots.
- Flick / Forehand Roller: A flick or forehand roller is a type of shot where the disc is rolled along the ground using a flick or forehand motion.
- Flip-up: A flip-up is a type of shot where the disc is released with an anhyzer angle and then flips up to flat or even turns over to create a turnover shot.
- Flip-to-flat: A flip-to-flat is a type of shot where the disc is released with an anhyzer angle and then flips up to a flat position before continuing on its trajectory towards the target.
- Grenede: A grenede, also known as a grenade, is a type of shot where the disc is thrown upside-down with a backhand motion, causing it to fly high into the air before coming back down towards the target.
- Hyzer: A hyzer is a type of throw where the disc is released with an angle that causes it to curve towards the player's dominant hand. This type of throw is often used to navigate around obstacles or to create more distance.
- Nose Down / Up: Nose down refers to a type of throw where the leading edge of the disc is pointing downwards during the flight, while nose up refers to a type of throw where the leading edge of the disc is pointing upwards during the flight.
- Patent-Pending: A patent-pending is a type of shot where the player is facing away from the target, with the disc held between their legs, and then throws the disc between their legs towards the target.
- Roller: A roller is a type of shot where the disc is thrown at a hyzer angle and then rolls along the ground towards the target. This type of shot is often used to navigate through tight spaces or to create a unique approach shot.
- Stable, Over/Under Stable: Stable refers to a type of disc that is designed to fly straight with minimal curve, while overstable refers to a type of disc that curves more sharply towards the player's dominant hand, and
- Stall / Stall-Hyzer: A throw that loses forward momentum and falls to the ground while turning in a hyzer angle.
- Spike / Spike Hyzer: A shot that is thrown with an extreme hyzer angle and hits the ground with a sharp angle to prevent rolling.
- Stall-Anhy: A shot that loses forward momentum and falls to the ground while turning in an anhyzer angle.
- Thumber: A throwing technique in which the disc is held with the thumb on top and thrown vertically with an overhand motion, usually used for short to medium range shots with a high arcing flight path.
- Tomahawk: A throwing technique similar to the thumber, but with the disc held with the fingers on top and thrown with a chopping motion, resulting in a flatter, more direct flight path. Often used for longer range shots.

#### Putts
- Battle Putt: A putt that is made under pressure, usually in a competitive setting where the outcome of the game may be affected by the success or failure of the putt.
- Flick / Pistol: A putting style where the player holds the disc with their fingers on the rim and their thumb on top, and then flicks the disc towards the basket. It's also known as a pistol putt.

- Push Putt: A putting technique where the player uses a straight-arm motion to push the disc towards the basket, rather than using a swinging motion like in a spin putt. This technique is often used for shorter putts.
- Scoober: An overhand throwing technique where the player releases the disc with an upside-down grip, causing the disc to fly in a similar way to a frisbee. This technique is often used to throw over obstacles or to get around trees.
- Spin Putt: A putting technique where the player generates spin on the disc by using a backhand throwing motion. This technique is often used for longer putts and provides more control and accuracy than a push putt.
- Straddle: A stance used during putting where the player spreads their legs wide apart to create more stability and balance.
