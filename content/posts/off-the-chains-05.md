*"So, going back to that road trip in '76 in the Rockies, where did you end up after that?"*

Chains McGraw: "Well, let's see, it was the summer of '76, so that's when I had come down off the mountain and ended up finding an unknown road that followed the Snake River. I found myself deep in the heart of Idaho with nothing but a map and a bag full of discs. I was on a mission to explore the uncharted territories of the disc golf world and nothing was going to stop me. But little did I know, my thirst for adventure was about to be tested like never before.

As I wandered deeper into the wilderness, I soon realized that I had made a fatal mistake: I had forgotten to pack a compass. Without any sense of direction, I felt like a ship without a rudder. The sun was beating down on me, and I could feel the thirst creeping up inside me. But I had to keep going. I had to find my way back to civilization.

I trudged on, my trusty map clutched in my hand. But the map might as well have been written in a foreign language, for all the good it did me. The trail soon disappeared, and I found myself in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but trees and silence. Panic set in as I realized how truly lost I was.

But then, in the distance, I saw something that gave me hope: a glimmer of light. I stumbled towards it, my heart pounding with excitement. And what I found was a miracle: a small cabin, nestled in a clearing. The owner, a grizzled old man with a long white beard, took me in and gave me shelter.

Over the next few days, I learned the art of survival from the old man. He taught me how to find food in the wilderness, how to start a fire, and how to navigate without a compass. And in the evenings, we played disc golf together, using trees as targets.

But eventually, I knew I had to leave. I thanked the old man for his kindness and set out again, my map now crumpled and torn, but my spirit unbroken. And after several more days of wandering, I finally stumbled upon a road. A car appeared in the distance, and I flagged it down.

Looking back on that adventure, I realized that it wasn't just about finding my way back to civilization. It was about discovering the true spirit of disc golf: the ability to adapt to any situation, to never give up, and to find joy in the journey. And what better analogy for life itelf is there than that? That, my man, is what makes disc golf so much more than what meets the eye."
