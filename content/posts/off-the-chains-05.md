*We recently spoke out on the course about "pencil whippers". Want to share your thoughts with the readers?*

Chains McGraw: "Pencil whippers? Ha! Those are some of the most cowardly, pathetic creatures to ever crawl the golf course. They're nothing but liars and cheats who would sell their own mothers for a lower handicap.

The game of golf is about honor and integrity, not some phony scorecard with falsified numbers. If you can't handle the challenge of a difficult hole or a bad shot, then you shouldn't be playing the game in the first place.

The worst part about pencil whippers is that they think they're fooling everyone, but they're only fooling themselves. They're too weak and spineless to face their shortcomings and work on improving their game the right way. They'd rather cheat and steal their way to victory, like a bunch of rats in a sewer.

If you ask me, pencil whippers should be banned from the game of golf altogether. They don't deserve to call themselves golfers, and they certainly don't deserve to be on the same course as real players who play the game with honesty and dignity."
