If you weren't able to make it out last week, let me regail you with tales of tournaments and Hobo Disc Golf. Last weekend, an amazing event unfolded at Lost Lake Disc Golf Course in Grass Valley. It was the AM Rush tournament, a two-day extravaganza that also saw the debut of our very own Hobo DG Bag Tags.

As the sun began its descent on Friday evening, Hobo Joe, a true disciple of the hobo lifestyle, set up camp near the course, ready to embrace the freedom of the open road. With his trusty hobo sack and a heart filled with anticipation, he knew that this would be a weekend to remember.

The tournament kicked off on Saturday morning, and the air was thick with excitement and a touch of nervous anticipation. The previous event at Lost Lake had tested the resolve of even the most dedicated players with its onslaught of rain, hail, and snow. But this time, the weather gods smiled upon us, gracing the tournament with perfect conditions. The sun shone brightly, the breeze whispered through the trees, and the spirit of the course came alive.

Lost Lake Disc Golf Course revealed its true essence, with its challenging layout, long fairways, and dramatic elevation changes. Players had to summon every ounce of skill, strategy, and resilience to conquer this majestic beast. Yet, despite the trials and tribulations, the sense of camaraderie and the joy of the game permeated the atmosphere.

My friends, it was a spectacle to behold. Laughter echoed across the fairways, high-fives and fist bumps were exchanged, and bonds were forged on the greens. The spirit of Hobo Disc Golf thrived, embracing the hobo way of lifeâ€”living in the moment, finding solace in nature, and cherishing the simple pleasures that the game offers.

Hobo Joe, the spirited soul behind Hobo Disc Golf, was overwhelmed with gratitude for the support shown by the community. The cheers and applause reverberated in his heart, filling him with a sense of purpose and accomplishment. And on the heels of this, he decided to schedule the next casual Hobo DG Bag Tag round at Auburn Regional on Sunday, June 25th, at 10:00 am. It's a chance for enthusiasts to come together, share stories, and challenge each other in the Hobo DG Tag ranks.

As the tournament came to a close, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with vibrant hues of purple, orange, and pink. The echoes of laughter and the clink of disc against chains lingered in the air. Lost Lake Disc Golf Course had etched itself deeply into the hearts of all who had ventured there.

So, my friends, if you seek adventure, camaraderie, and the thrill of the game, join the Hobo Disc Golf community. Embrace the spirit of the open road, the joy of competition, and the serenity of nature. Let us gather at Auburn Regional on that fateful Sunday in June, ready to create new stories, forge lasting friendships, and experience the magic of Hobo Disc Golf. And of course, vie for that #1 tag ;) (we're coming for you Chris!)
