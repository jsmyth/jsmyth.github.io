*"Is there any one particular adventure that sticks out to you?"*

Chains McGraw:
"I've been on many wild disc golf adventures in my time, that's for sure. Hmmmmmmmm... Let me tell you about the time I played a round with a group of eccentric hippies deep in the heart of the California redwoods.

It was the summer of '78, and I was making my way up the coast with my trusty disc golf bag in tow. I had heard rumors of a group of hippies living off the grid in a remote corner of the redwoods, and I was determined to find them and challenge them to a round of disc golf.

After a few days of hiking through the thick, wet forest, I finally stumbled upon their encampment. The hippies welcomed me with open arms, and we spent the afternoon smoking weed and drinking homemade wine. When I mentioned that I was a disc golfer, their eyes lit up, and they eagerly agreed to play a round with me.

We hiked up to their makeshift disc golf course, which was set up in a clearing surrounded by towering redwoods. The holes were marked by piles of stones, and the baskets were made from old bicycle rims. It was unlike any course I had ever played before, but I was up for the challenge.

The hippies insisted that we play a game they called "Cosmic Disc Golf," which involved playing at night using glow-in-the-dark discs. I was skeptical at first, but after a few hits off the communal bong, I was all in.

The round was unlike any I had ever played before. The glow of the discs illuminating the dark forest created an otherworldly atmosphere. The hippies were skilled players, but their laid-back attitude and love of nature made for a relaxed and fun game.

After the round, we sat around a campfire and shared stories late into the night. As the embers burned low, I realized that this was what disc golf was really all about - connecting with people from all walks of life over a shared love of the game.

I may have played some wild rounds of disc golf in my time, but that night in the redwoods with the hippies will always hold a special place in my heart."
