Join us June 17th and 18th in Grass Valley at the Lost Lake Disc Golf Course for the [AM Rush tournament](https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/The_Am_Rush_2023) which will also include the innagural [Hobo Disc Golf Bag Tag](https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/bag-tags) kick-off!

In addition to the tournament, everyone will also receive a complimentary Hobo Disc Golf Bag Tag. Each player will receive their tag on Sunday according to their scores for round 1. It will be up to the players how they want to resolve ties. After that, how they are used is up to you. Play the second round for tags with your cardmates, friends, or just hang on to yours until you run into another Hobo DG player on the road and are up for the challenge.

[This page](https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/bag-tags) lists the players and their tag numbers. You can always reach out to jim@hobodiscgolf.com to have your tag number updated on the list until our app is ready.
