### A look back at the Week
Hobo Joe was lucky enough to participate in the [Sierra Spring Cup](https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/Sierra_Spring_Cup_2023) hosted by the Tuolumne Disc Golf Club at [Three Links Camp](https://www.discgolfscene.com/courses/Three_Links_Camp). It was a fantastic event at a simply gorgeous location. Mountain golf is Disc Golf and Three Links Camp is mountain golf at its finest.
