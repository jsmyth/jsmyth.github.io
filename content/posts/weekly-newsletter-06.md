![Close-up of a stack of green d6 dice](/img/cabin-dice.avif)
Our new board has a name, Flick and Roll. We have received the first prototype deck of cards and are iterating on it to make some minor improvements and are continuing game testing as well. Keep an eye out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HoboDG/) or [IG](https://www.instagram.com/HoboDiscGolf/) for any updates. And if you run into Hobo Joe on the road or on the course, be sure to ask to play a game, he's always looking for takers.
