*What would you say your favorite course in Norther California is?*

Chains McGraw: "Now that's a good question. So many to choose from throughout the years. That's pretty tough, but put to it, I'd have to go with Brooktrails in Willits. It's hard to put into words just how beautiful that place is. It's a disc golf course nestled deep in the heart of Northern California, surrounded by towering redwoods and verdant greenery as far as the eye can see. Every time I've been there, I've been struck by the sheer majesty of the place. It's like stepping into another world, one where nature reigns supreme and everything else falls away.

The thing that really sets Brooktrails apart, though, is the way the disc golf course is integrated into the natural surroundings. The green golf greens and fairways wind their way through the towering redwoods, creating a magical landscape that's both surreal and breathtaking. The contrast of the bright green grass against the towering giants of the forest is a sight to behold, and one that's hard to forget.

I remember one time in particular when I was playing a round at Brooktrails. It was a warm, sunny day, and the light was filtering down through the trees in a way that made everything seem almost ethereal. I was standing on the tee of hole 6, a long, winding fairway that disappeared into the woods. As I looked down the fairway, I was struck by the sheer beauty of the scene before me. The green grass was like a ribbon winding its way through the forest, while the redwoods towered above like silent sentinels. It was a moment of pure, unadulterated awe.

As I made my way down the fairway, I couldn't help but feel like I was a part of something greater than myself. The way the course was laid out, it felt like it had always been there, a natural extension of the forest itself. And as I threw my discs and watched them soar through the air, I couldn't help but feel a sense of joy and freedom that's hard to come by in our busy, modern lives.

In the end, that's what Brooktrails is really all about. It's a place where we can escape the trappings of civilization and connect with the natural world in a way that's hard to put into words. Whether you're a seasoned disc golfer or just someone looking for a little bit of peace and quiet, I can't recommend this place enough. So if you ever find yourself in Northern California, do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Brooktrails. You won't be disappointed."
