As Hunter S. Thompson once said, "Good people drink good beer." And in Northern California, good people also play good disc golf.

The disc golf courses of Northern California are an absolute treasure that few people outside of the sport truly appreciate.

The rolling hills and majestic trees of Gold Country make for a stunning backdrop to some of the best disc golf courses in the state. From beginner-friendly nine-hole courses to championship-level 18-hole courses, there's something for all disc golf lovers.

One such course is New Hogan Dam, located in the town of Valley Springs. New Hogan is a true gem, nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The course winds through the hills and trees, offering players a challenging and rewarding round of disc golf.

Another must-play course in Northern California is Lake Amador, located near the town of Ione. This course features a mix of open fairways and wooded holes, with the lake itself coming into play on several holes. The course is challenging but fair, and the views of the surrounding countryside are simply breathtaking.
