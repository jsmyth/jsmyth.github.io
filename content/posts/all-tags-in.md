#### Hobo Disc Golf All Tags In!
Join us Dec 16th in Placerville at the Feather Garden Disc Golf Course for the [Feather Garden Donation Event](https://www.discgolfscene.com/tournaments/Feather_Garden_Donation_Event_2023) which will also include the end-of-year [Hobo Disc Golf Bag Tag](https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/bagtags/) All In celebration!

You do not need a bag tag to play in the dontaion event, but if you don't have one and would like to get your hands on one, I will have some extra to purchase on-site.

We have posted a page [here](https://www.hobodiscgolf.com/bagtags/) that lists the players and their tag numbers. You can always reach out to jim@hobodiscgolf.com to have your tag number updated on the list after your rounds, until our app is ready.

Registration opens Tuesday Oct 17 so set your reminders and we'll see you there!
