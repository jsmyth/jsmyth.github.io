#### What are Hobo Disc Golf Bag Tags?

At least once a year, Hobo Disc Golf will sponsor a local tournament to initially seed and handout tags in-person as a community. You can also purchase a tag for $20 if you are not able to make it to the tournament(s) by contacting jim@hobodiscgolf.com. After that, you can challenge anyone, anywhere, that also has a Hobo Disc Golf Tag. You can contact jim@hobodiscgolf.com to update your tag number in the table below until our app is ready.
