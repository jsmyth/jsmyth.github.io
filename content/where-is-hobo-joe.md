I will try to keep this as up-to-date and as accurate as I can in the possibility that some of you out there may want to challenge Hobo Joe to a bag tag round or simply would just like to play a casual round somewhere. Joe will have the board game, Flick and Roll, with him too so if you're interested in trying it out and being one of the early testers, be sure to ask! You can contact Hobo Joe on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HoboDG/) or [IG](https://www.instagram.com/HoboDiscGolf/) or by emailing jim@hobodiscgolf.com
